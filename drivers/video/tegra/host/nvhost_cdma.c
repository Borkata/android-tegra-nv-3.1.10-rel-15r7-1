 *   2: NumSlots (how many pushbuffer slots to free)
 *   3: NumHandles
 *   4: nvmap client which pinned the handles
 *   5..: NumHandles * nvmemhandle to unpin
 *
 * There's always one word unused, so (accounting for wrap):
 *   - Write == Read => queue empty
 *   - Write + 1 == Read => queue full
 * The queue must not be left with less than SYNC_QUEUE_MIN_ENTRY words
 * of space at the end of the array.
 *
 * We want to pass contiguous arrays of handles to nvmap_unpin_handles,
 * so arrays that would wrap at the end of the buffer will be split into
 * two (or more) entries.
